    <!-- mirrors
     | This is a list of mirrors to be used in downloading artifacts from remote repositories.
     |
     | It works like this: a POM may declare a repository to use in resolving certain artifacts.
     | However, this repository may have problems with heavy traffic at times, so people have mirrored
     | it to several places.
     |
     | That repository definition will have a unique id, so we can create a mirror reference for that
     | repository, to be used as an alternate download site. The mirror site will be the preferred
     | server for that repository.
