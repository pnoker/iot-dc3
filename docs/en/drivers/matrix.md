# Driver Capability Matrix

This page gives an at-a-glance view of all **28 drivers** in IoT DC3 — their protocol category and their read / write /
subscribe capabilities — so you can match a protocol to your needs fast. Each row links to that driver's own page, where
attributes, polling cadence, and a minimal onboarding example are spelled out.

Read / write / subscribe reflect each driver's actual current implementation: "✓" means the capability is in place, "—"
means the driver does not implement that direction, deliberately does not offer it by design, or is still a skeleton —
code is the source of truth (see the note after the tables). Subscribe / report means the driver passively receives
device pushes (listens on a port, network callbacks, device registration, etc.), as opposed to periodic polling.

## Industrial Bus / PLC

These drivers act as masters (clients) that actively connect to the device, poll values
per [Point](../introduction/concepts/point) and write via [commands](../introduction/concepts/command); they do not
listen for pushes. `ethernet-ip` is currently a protocol skeleton — CIP framing is not yet complete.

## SCADA / Power / Metering

Building, power, and metering protocols. `bacnet-ip` and `snmp` read and write actively; `sl651` is hydrology
telemetry — it opens a TCP server and passively receives reports, hence subscribe only; `iec104` and `dlms` are
currently skeletons.

| Driver (dc3.driver.code)                    | Category             | Read | Write | Subscribe/Report | Notes                                  |

## IoT / Wireless

IoT and wireless drivers. `mqtt` is publish/subscribe — values arrive passively via subscription (no active read),
commands can be sent; `lwm2m` (embedded server, receives device registration and notifications) covers read, write, and
subscribe; `coap`, `http`, `ble`, and `can` are request-response active read/write; `zigbee` is currently a skeleton
that only listens for coordinator network state — it does not yet listen for node join or attribute reports, so its
subscribe capability is not implemented.

## Serial / Generic Network

Generic pass-through drivers that frame requests from a command template, sending and receiving actively without
listening.

## Database

Treat a table as a data source: reads go through `executeQuery`, writes through `executeUpdate`, driven by the SQL
template on each [Point](../introduction/concepts/point); no change subscription.

## Virtual / Testing

Two drivers with no real device: `virtual` generates simulated read values by point type (write is a placeholder,
nothing hits a device); `listening-virtual` runs in reverse, opening TCP/UDP servers to receive external pushes and able
to write back to a device over the connection channel.

| Driver (dc3.driver.code)                                            | Category        | Read | Write | Subscribe/Report | Notes                                            |

::: info Capability marks are code-driven
The "✓ / —" in these tables reflect what each driver's `*DriverCustomServiceImpl` actually implements today: a "—" may
mean the protocol direction simply is not offered (e.g. `virtual` write, `mqtt` active read), or that the skeleton is
not yet filled in (e.g. `ethernet-ip`, `iec104`, `dlms`). For the final behavior, consult that module's `read()` /
`write()` / `initial()` source; this table is kept in sync as drivers evolve.
