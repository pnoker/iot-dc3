# Driver Capability Matrix

This page gives an at-a-glance view of all **28 drivers** in IoT DC3 — their protocol category, read / write /
subscribe capabilities, and implementation status — so you can match a protocol to your needs fast. Each row links to
that driver's own page, where attributes, polling cadence, and a minimal onboarding example are spelled out.

Read / write / subscribe reflect each driver's actual current implementation: "✓" means the capability is in place, "—"
means the driver does not implement that direction, deliberately does not offer it by design, or is still a skeleton —
code is the source of truth (see the note after the tables). Subscribe / report means the driver passively receives
device pushes (listens on a port, network callbacks, device registration, etc.), as opposed to periodic polling.

The "Status" column summarizes each driver's overall maturity:

- **Complete**: read / write / subscribe are fully implemented per the protocol design and ready for production
  onboarding.
- **Usable**: the core path works, but there are local gaps (e.g. some data types, Observe, or health hooks); see the
  Notes and the driver page.
- **Skeleton**: protocol framing or transport is not yet implemented; currently serves as a structural reference only
  and cannot collect from real devices.

## Industrial Bus / PLC

These drivers act as masters (clients) that actively connect to the device, poll values
per [Point](../introduction/concepts/point) and write via [commands](../introduction/concepts/command); they do not
listen for pushes. `ethernet-ip` is currently a protocol skeleton — CIP framing is not yet complete.

## SCADA / Power / Metering

Building, power, and metering protocols. `bacnet-ip` and `snmp` read and write actively; `sl651` is hydrology
telemetry — it opens a TCP server and passively receives reports, hence subscribe only; `iec104` and `dlms` are
currently skeletons.

## IoT / Wireless

IoT and wireless drivers. `mqtt` is publish/subscribe — values arrive passively via subscription (no active read),
commands can be sent; `lwm2m` (embedded server, receives device registration and notifications) has read and write in
place but its Observe/subscribe is not yet implemented; `coap`, `http`, `ble`, and `can` are request-response active
read/write (`coap` Observe not implemented); `can` and `zigbee` are currently skeletons — `zigbee` only listens for
coordinator network state (not node join or attribute reports), and `can` is backed by can-utils.

## Serial / Generic Network

Generic pass-through drivers that frame requests from a command template, sending and receiving actively without
listening.

## Database

Treat a table as a data source: reads go through `executeQuery`, writes through `executeUpdate`, driven by the SQL
template on each [Point](../introduction/concepts/point); no change subscription.

| Driver (dc3.driver.code)                        | Category | Read | Write | Subscribe/Report | Status   | Notes                   |

| [PostgreSQL](./postgresql) (`PostgresqlDriver`) | Database | ✓    | ✓     | —                | Complete | Read points from tables |
| [Oracle](./oracle) (`OracleDriver`)             | Database | ✓    | ✓     | —                | Complete | Read points from tables |
| [SQL Server](./sqlserver) (`SqlserverDriver`)   | Database | ✓    | ✓     | —                | Complete | Read points from tables |

## Virtual / Testing

Two drivers with no real device: `virtual` generates simulated read values by point type (write is a placeholder,
nothing hits a device); `listening-virtual` runs in reverse, opening TCP/UDP servers to receive external pushes and able
to write back to a device over the connection channel.

| [Listening Virtual](./listening-virtual) (`ListeningVirtualDriver`) | Virtual/Testing | —    | ✓     | ✓                | Complete | TCP/UDP server ingest, can write back            |

::: info Capability marks are code-driven
The "✓ / —" in these tables reflect what each driver's `*DriverCustomServiceImpl` actually implements today: a "—" may
mean the protocol direction simply is not offered (e.g. `virtual` write, `mqtt` active read), or that the skeleton is
not yet filled in (e.g. `ethernet-ip`, `iec104`, `dlms`, `can`). The "Status" column is an overall maturity summary;
finer data-type or sub-capability gaps are flagged on each driver page via `::: warning` / `::: info`. For the final
behavior, consult that module's `read()` / `write()` / `initial()` source; this table is kept in sync as drivers evolve.
